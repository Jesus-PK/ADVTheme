# Additional Controls

This theme comes bundled additional UserControls. Below is general documentation on them and their usage.

## MessageWindow

This is a message window that users can use to show messages to users. This comes bundled with built in support for picking the icon to display on the window title and with the message to be displayed. It also supports including custom controls that can be displayed on the window, such as a drop down menu. This is to help alleviate the need to make multiple versions of the same control.
